RiotWatcher v2.4.0
==================

|pypi| |docs| |build| |coverage| |lgmt|

Check for full (read: slightly better) documentation `here <http://riot-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__!

RiotWatcher is a thin wrapper on top of the `Riot Games API for League
of Legends <https://developer.riotgames.com/>`__. All public methods as
of 8/23/2018 are supported in full.

RiotWatcher by default supports a naive rate limiter. This rate limiter will
try to stop you from making too many requests, and in a single threaded test
environment does this rather well. In a multithreaded environment, you may
still get some 429 errors. 429 errors are currently NOT retried for you.

To Start...
-----------

To install RiotWatcher:

::

    pip install riotwatcher

OR for development/testing, clone and run:

::

    pip install -e .[dev]

You also need to have an API key from Riot. Get that from
`here <https://developer.riotgames.com/>`__.

Using it...
-----------

All methods return dictionaries representing the json objects described
by the official Riot API. Any HTTP errors that are returned by the API are
raised as HTTPError exceptions from the Requests library.

.. code:: python

    from riotwatcher import RiotWatcher

    watcher = RiotWatcher('<your-api-key>')

    my_region = 'na1'

    me = watcher.summoner.by_name(my_region, 'pseudonym117')
    print(me)

    # all objects are returned (by default) as a dict
    # lets see if i got diamond yet (i probably didnt)
    my_ranked_stats = watcher.league.positions_by_summoner(my_region, me['id'])
    print(my_ranked_stats)

    # Lets some champions
    static_champ_list = watcher.static_data.champions(my_region)
    print(static_champ_list)

    # Error checking requires importing HTTPError from requests

    from requests import HTTPError

    # For Riot's API, the 404 status code indicates that the requested data wasn't found and
    # should be expected to occur in normal operation, as in the case of a an
    # invalid summoner name, match ID, etc.
    #
    # The 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests
    # in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").

    try:
        response = watcher.summoner.by_name(my_region, 'this_is_probably_not_anyones_summoner_name')
    except HTTPError as err:
        if err.response.status_code == 429:
            print('We should retry in {} seconds.'.format(e.headers['Retry-After']))
            print('this retry-after is handled by default by the RiotWatcher library')
            print('future requests wait until the retry-after time passes')
        elif err.response.status_code == 404:
            print('Summoner with that ridiculous name not found.')
        else:
            raise

Advanced
--------

All rate limiting, caching, and data transformation is handled by objects
extending the Handlers.RequestHandler class. These are completely user
configurable.

TODO: add more info about this

Testing
-------

There currently are 2 sets of tests. There are basic unit tests for API related
functionality, and there is a full system test, which directly accesses the
API.

Unit tests can be run with the following command from the RiotWatcher folder:

::

    python -m unittest

Full access API tests should be run by first creating a file named api_key,
which should contain a valid API key (no newline), to the folder Riot-Watcher.
Then the following command will run the full system test (WARNING: it takes
quite some time to run; definitely hits the dev key rate limit):

::

    python -m unittest discover -p full_test*.py

Known Issues
------------

Rate limiter has some race conditions when used concurrently.

someone will want them.

Some code changed to look slightly nicer too.

v1.1.8 - 9/4/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated APIs supported. Updated APIs:

-  league-v2.5
-  team-v2.4

Don't worry, support for match data is coming. I just wanted to commit
these changes first, since they already had tests.

v1.1.7 - 8/10/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed issue #4 (forgot to change a number, oops) and made it much much
less likely for me to do it again (moved api version part of url into a
different method just to be sure I don't mess it up).

Also there are now TESTS!! WOO! Everyone rejoice. They aren't very good
tests though, so don't be too excited. BUT if they should detect if
there's a clear issue in the API wrapper.

Oh and some better formatting done (spaces not tabs, more consistent
indentation, etc.). Should be no functional difference at all.

v1.1.6 - 6/19/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added support for regional proxies, because EUW broke without it

v1.1.5 - 5/9/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cause what do version numbers really mean anyways?

Actually add endpoints to league API that I just forgot to add. Change
is NOT backwards compatible, any use of the old league api calls will
need to be changed, in addition to the riot changes.

Newly supported API's: - league-v2.4 - team-v2.3

v1.1.1 - 5/3/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix issue with static calls, namely that they didn't do anything right
before. Now they work.

v1.1 - 4/29/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated to latest API versions, now supported API's are:

-  champion-v1.2
-  game-v1.3
-  league-v2.3
-  lol-static-data-v1.2
-  stats-v1.3
-  summoner-v1.4
-  team-v2.2

Changes are NOT backwards compatible, you will need to update any code
that used an old API version. Check `Riots
documentation <https://developer.riotgames.com/change-history>`__ for
more information on what changes were made

v1.0.2 - 2/25/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
