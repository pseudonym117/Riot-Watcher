RiotWatcher
===========

|pypi| |docs| |coverage| |black|

Check for full (read: slightly better) documentation `here <http://riot-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__!

RiotWatcher is a thin wrapper on top of the `Riot Games API for League
of Legends <https://developer.riotgames.com/>`__. All public methods as
of 10/29/2022 are supported in full.

RiotWatcher by default supports a naive rate limiter. This rate limiter will
try to stop you from making too many requests, and in a single threaded test
environment does this rather well. In a multithreaded environment, you may
still get some 429 errors. 429 errors are currently NOT retried for you.


To Start...
-----------

To install RiotWatcher:

::

    pip install riotwatcher

OR for development/testing, clone and run:

::

    pip install -e .[dev]
    pre-commit install

You also need to have an API key from Riot. Get that from
`here <https://developer.riotgames.com/>`__.

Using it...
-----------

All methods return dictionaries representing the json objects described
by the official Riot API. Any HTTP errors that are returned by the API are
raised as HTTPError exceptions from the Requests library.

.. code:: python

    from riotwatcher import LolWatcher, ApiError

    lol_watcher = LolWatcher('<your-api-key>')

    my_region = 'na1'

    me = lol_watcher.summoner.by_name(my_region, 'pseudonym117')
    print(me)

    # all objects are returned (by default) as a dict
    # lets see if i got diamond yet (i probably didnt)
    my_ranked_stats = lol_watcher.league.by_summoner(my_region, me['id'])
    print(my_ranked_stats)

    # First we get the latest version of the game from data dragon
    versions = lol_watcher.data_dragon.versions_for_region(my_region)
    champions_version = versions['n']['champion']

    # Lets get some champions
    current_champ_list = lol_watcher.data_dragon.champions(champions_version)
    print(current_champ_list)

    # For Riot's API, the 404 status code indicates that the requested data wasn't found and
    # should be expected to occur in normal operation, as in the case of a an
    # invalid summoner name, match ID, etc.
    #
    # The 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests
    # in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").

    try:
        response = lol_watcher.summoner.by_name(my_region, 'this_is_probably_not_anyones_summoner_name')
    except ApiError as err:
        if err.response.status_code == 429:
            print('We should retry in {} seconds.'.format(err.response.headers['Retry-After']))
            print('this retry-after is handled by default by the RiotWatcher library')
            print('future requests wait until the retry-after time passes')
        elif err.response.status_code == 404:
            print('Summoner with that ridiculous name not found.')
        else:
            raise


DataDragon
----------

Keep in mind when using data dragon APIs with LolWatcher that regions are NOT the same as the other API regions.
Specifically, the following regions are renamed (as of writing):

======== ===========
**API**  **ddragon**
-------- -----------
eun1     eune
oc1      oce
======== ===========


StatusApiV4
-----------

As of 10/14/2021 (and from the looks of it, indefinitely), both v3 and v4 versions of the LolStatus API are supported by Riot.
As such, RiotWatcher provides a method to use both. By default, the v3 API will be used for backwards compatibility.

To use the v4 API by default, use the following to initialize your LolWatcher instance:

.. code:: python

    from riotwatcher import LolWatcher

    lol_watcher = LolWatcher('<your-api-key>', default_status_v4=True)

    # example call
    matchlist = lol_watcher.lol_status.platform_data('na1')

To explicitly use v4 or v5 during the deprecation period, you can use the following properties:


.. code:: python

    from riotwatcher import LolWatcher

    lol_watcher = LolWatcher('<your-api-key>')

    # use v4 explicitly
    matchlist = lol_watcher.lol_status_v4.platform_data('na1')

    # use v3 explicitly
    old_matchlist = lol_watcher.lol_status_v3.shard_data('na1')

Note: this will not be supported after v3 is completely deprecated! Both lol_status_v3 and lol_status_v4 properties will be removed,
and the change will happen with a minor version increase. If you desire seamless backwards compatibility, do not use these
properies.


Use with kernel
---------------

RiotWatcher can integrate with the API proxy/caching server `kernel <https://github.com/meraki-analytics/kernel/>`__.
This can be done by providing the ``kernel_url`` parameter to the ``LolWatcher`` constructor.

.. code:: python

    from riotwatcher import LolWatcher, ApiError

    lol_watcher = LolWatcher(kernel_url="https://your-kernel-instance") # should not contain trailing slash
    # use watcher as normal
    
Testing
-------

Unit tests can be run with the following command from the RiotWatcher folder:

::

    tox

Known Issues
------------

Rate limiter has some race conditions when used concurrently.

Some game constants updated, if anyone has actually been using them.

v1.2.1 - 10/14/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add lol-status API. not a huge thing but i had time to do it.

v1.2 - 9/4/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added Match and MatchHistory APIs! Also are somewhat tested, but query
parameters are not tested.

Added some new constants. Probably not useful, but who knows. Maybe
someone will want them.

Some code changed to look slightly nicer too.

v1.1.8 - 9/4/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated APIs supported. Updated APIs:

-  league-v2.5
-  team-v2.4

Don't worry, support for match data is coming. I just wanted to commit
these changes first, since they already had tests.

v1.1.7 - 8/10/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed issue #4 (forgot to change a number, oops) and made it much much
less likely for me to do it again (moved api version part of url into a
different method just to be sure I don't mess it up).

Also there are now TESTS!! WOO! Everyone rejoice. They aren't very good
tests though, so don't be too excited. BUT if they should detect if
there's a clear issue in the API wrapper.

Oh and some better formatting done (spaces not tabs, more consistent
indentation, etc.). Should be no functional difference at all.

v1.1.6 - 6/19/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added support for regional proxies, because EUW broke without it

v1.1.5 - 5/9/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cause what do version numbers really mean anyways?

Actually add endpoints to league API that I just forgot to add. Change
is NOT backwards compatible, any use of the old league api calls will
need to be changed, in addition to the riot changes.

Newly supported API's: - league-v2.4 - team-v2.3

v1.1.1 - 5/3/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix issue with static calls, namely that they didn't do anything right
before. Now they work.

v1.1 - 4/29/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated to latest API versions, now supported API's are:

-  champion-v1.2
-  game-v1.3
-  league-v2.3
-  lol-static-data-v1.2
-  stats-v1.3
-  summoner-v1.4
-  team-v2.2

Changes are NOT backwards compatible, you will need to update any code
that used an old API version. Check `Riots
documentation <https://developer.riotgames.com/change-history>`__ for
more information on what changes were made

v1.0.2 - 2/25/2014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added Riots new methods to get teams by id. In methods
'get\_teams(team\_ids, region)' and 'get\_team(team\_id, region)'.
